## 🚀 Overview

This organization hosts the codebase and supporting materials for a modern full‑stack application. Our goal is to create a scalable, maintainable, and collaborative environment for development across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This organization may contain multiple repositories. Typical structure:

- **Frontend** – Client‑side application
- **Backend** – Server‑side application and APIs
- **Infrastructure** – Deployment, IaC, config, CI/CD scripts
- **Design-docs** – Architecture diagrams, decision logs, specs

## 🧰 Tech Stack

While individual repositories specify their exact stack, the baseline technologies include:

- **Frontend:** React, Three.js, Tailwind CSS, React Three Fiber (Three.js for React), Sparkjs (for Gaussian Splat loading & utilities), shadCN, React Bits (component libraries), Chart.js / Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express
- **Database:** TBC
- **Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions

## ✨ Development Standards

To maintain consistency across the organization, we follow these baseline guidelines:

### Code

- Use consistent code formatting (Prettier, ESLint)
- Favor clear, readable code over clever solutions
- Use TypeScript where possible

### Git

- Write clear commit messages, we use the conventional commit format enforced by commitizen
- Prefer feature‑branch workflow and pull requests

### Documentation

- Maintain an up‑to‑date README per repository
- Include setup steps, environment variables, and common workflows

## 🛠 Getting Started

Instructions vary by repository, but generally you can:

1. Clone the needed repositories
2. Install dependencies
3. Set environment variables as described in each repo
4. Run local development
